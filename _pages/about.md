I am Mingzhe Li, a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Computing at the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute (SCI), University of Utah. My Ph.D. advisor is Dr. Bei Wang Phillips. My current research interests include topological data analysis, scientific visualization, and machine learning. 

Before my Ph.D. program, I received my M.S. degree from the University of Southern California and B.Eng degree from Zhejiang University, both in Computer Science.
