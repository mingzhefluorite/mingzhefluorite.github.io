I am Mingzhe Li. I will be a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Notre Dame starting Nov, 2025. I obtained my Ph.D. from University of Utah, with Prof. Bei Wang Phillips as my advisor. My current research interests include topological data analysis, scientific visualization, machine learning, and high-performance computing. 

I received my M.S. degree from the University of Southern California and B.Eng degree from Zhejiang University, both in Computer Science.

Feel free to reach out to me via email if you are interested in collaboration!
